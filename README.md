# HFP-Analytics

A REST API that 

- provides [HFP data](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/vehicle-positions/) from the past in a compact format for further use;
- analyzes the expected vs. actual quality of HFP data with various metrics.

The API is under early development and currently not public.

## Development

> **TODO:** OS and tool requirements, setting up a dev environment, running tests, getting and using test data, inspecting local dev and remote Azure databases as well as generating migration scripts with Migra, etc.

## Deployment

The API is hosted in [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/), and the database in [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/)

> **TODO:** Deployment in Azure at a general level (and how to get detailed instructions not published here).
